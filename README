3. Requirements
---------------
C++ compiler(I'm using gcc 2.95.4 and gcc 3.0.2)
libstdc++
GTK version 1.2.6 or higher
Gettext 0.10.35 or higher

4. Compile and install
----------------------
Unpack the archive and enter aria source directory,
	./configure
	make
	make install

Since version 0.10.0, you don't need to run mksetup.
If .aria directory does not exist in your home directory, Aria automatically
creates it and copies necessary files into it.

If you want to initialize these configuration files, run Aria with "--initrc"
option.

I recommend to run Aria with "--init" every time you run the new version of
Aria for the first time.
(Please make back up copies of your setting files(rc.aria, useragent.aria,
server.aria, command.aria) if necessary.

5. If you are using galeon,...
------------------------------
In galeon setting menu, choose "handler->download".
In "Program" frame, choose "use command line"(or something like that),
and enter "aria -g %s" in "Command" entry.
(If you don't install Aria in search path, you may have to enter full
path of aria.)

Now, you can download every thing by Aria from galeon.

6. Configuration
----------------
If you wish to specify the font manually, edit ~/.aria/rc.aria.

The directory ~/.aria/save/ contains several configuration and save file:
Download list is saved to list.aria at the end of every session.

default.aria contains default item option for new list.

http_proxy.aria contains HTTP proxy server information. The syntax of this
file is:
SERVERNAME[(':'|' ')PORT]
If PORT is omitted, 8080 is used. The lines starting '#' are a comment.

useragent.aria containes User-Agent definition. You can add your favorite
User-Agent there. The lines starting '#' are treated as comment lines.

server.aria is a Server Template File. This file defines file retrieving
procedure for specific web servers. Please read resources/server.aria.template
and server.aria.

command.aria is a command list that is executed when each download completes.
Please read resources/command.aria.template.

7. ICON SET
-----------
Icon set is a collection of icons that represents download status(1st column
of download list).

The icon set path is ~/.aria/statusIcon/iconset
Create a directory under it, then place following xpm files in the directory
you created:
  filename     : memo
=====================================
  complete.xpm : download complete
  download.xpm : download in progress
  lock.xpm     : locked
  ready.xpm    : ready
  divide.xpm   : split download
  error.xpm    : error
  stop.xpm     : stop

Note that the size of xpm is 30x25.

You can select your own icon set in application settings menu.
In Display tab, select your favorit icon set, then click "Apply" button.
The entry name of icon set is the name of the directory you created.

8. pixmap for DND basket
------------------------
You can change the pixmap of DND basket.
Put pixmaps under ~/.aria/basket/pixmap

You can select pixmap in application settings menu.
In Basket tab, select pixmap, then click "Apply" button.
The entry name is the filename of pixmap.

Transparent pixmaps are supported.

9. FAQ
------

I. What is URL list?
--------------------
URLs deliminated by '\n' character
for example:
	foobar01.jpg
	foobar02.jpg
	foobar03.jpg

II. Please tell me the format of CRC/MD5 list
----------------------------------
valid format for CRC list is <filename> <CRC> [<filesize>].
<filesize> can be omissible.
e.g.
index.html     7e2a
download.html  cc34

As for MD5 list,
<MD5 checksum> <filename>

e.g.
c6ef4d3efaa05765a2e1823548e5ebba  index.html
f6144ae398cb959b9385cb8c5fbe474d  download.html

III. What is "paste URL list with numerical expansion" means?
-------------------------------------------------
If you copy an phrase "foobar_00-05.jpg", and activate this menu,
You can get following URLs:
	foobar_00.jpg
	foobar_01.jpg
	foobar_02.jpg
	foobar_03.jpg
	foobar_04.jpg
	foobar_05.jpg
You can specify alphabet in variable character like "foobar_aa-zz.jpg"
instead of decimal number. Also, "foobar_[aa-zz].jpg" produces same
results.

IV. What are the defferences between "Open URL list" and "Find Hyplerlink"?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
If the file you want to read contains just URL list, use "Open URL list".
If the file is html file, use "Find Hyperlink".
